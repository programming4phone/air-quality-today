# Air Quality Today

Air Quality Today is an Angular 2 application that that accesses air quality measurements directly from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Just enter your 5-digit zip code to retrieve the most recent air quality reading for your location. A map is displayed showing the location of the closest observation station.

The app is currently deployed on [Heroku] (https://air-quality-today-0100.herokuapp.com).

This app was originally an [Android app] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.programming4phone.air.quality) and was converted to Angular 2 to allow device independence.
